# Udacity-Arcade Game Project
This is a project I did for the Udacity [Front End Web developer nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). This game is loosely based on the arcade game [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger) . Some concepts and strategies this project demonstrates are html5 canvas, object oriented javascript and some new ES6 features.

## How to Play
* Use the arrow keys to navigate your character
* Avoid the bugs moving from left to right across the screen
* Move the character to the river at the top 10 times to win.
* The player has 5 lives, losing 1 each time a they run into a bug.
* If the player loses all 5 lives they lose.
*  The player can gain a life by reaching a tile with a heart on it. 
* The player can  slow time for 5 seconds by reaching a tile with a star on it.
